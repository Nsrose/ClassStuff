 A. $ cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa_cs61b

 B. Copy your private key from the instructional machines with:
      $ rsync -a LOGIN@torus.cs.berkeley.edu:.ssh/id_rsa ~/.ssh/id_rsa_cs61b
      replacing LOGIN with your login.

 C. Create the file .ssh/config (if you don't already have one) and add the
    line (touch ~/.ssh/confg)

    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_cs61b

 D. If you'd like to be able to use .ssh to log into your 
    instructional account from your home computer without the bother of
    a passphrase, you can so by executing the following command on the
    instructional server (NOT your home machine):

    $ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

    (Yes, that is ">>", meaning "append", not ">", which would 
    mean "overwrite").  At this point, you should be able to log into 
    your instructional account from home with

       $  ssh LOGIN@torus.cs.berkeley.edu

    (or some other server or workstation).
