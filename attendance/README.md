Attendance App Creator V1.0  
===========================  
  
Easy creation of a web app that your students can sign into on the  
last day of lecture to track extra credit attendance (for HKN surveys). 

Students will go to the URL generated by this script and enter their name and login. Instructors can find all the students in attendance by going to the Firebase server they set up (see below) and hitting "export JSON" to get a JSON object of all the students that were there.  
  
You'll need Google App Engine:  
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python  
  
Download the Python SDK for your OS.   

You'll also need a Firebase server to collect the student's data:  
1) Go to https://www.firebase.com/  
2) Sign in if you already have an account, otherwise sign up.  
3) Make a new app with some app name. Your students will not see this.  
4) Click "Create New App" and click on the app name after creation to go to the Firebase server page.
