Attendance App Creator V1.0  
===========================  
  
Easy creation of a web app that your students can sign into on the  
last day of lecture to track extra credit attendance (for HKN surveys). 

Students will go to the URL generated by this script and enter their name and login. Instructors can find all the students in attendance by going to the Firebase server they set up (see below) and hitting "export JSON" to get a JSON object of all the students that were there.  
  
You'll need Google App Engine:  
https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python  
  
Download the Python SDK for your OS.   

Firebase
--------
You'll also need a Firebase server to collect the student's data:  
1) Go to https://www.firebase.com/  
2) Sign in if you already have an account, otherwise sign up.  
3) Make a new app with some app name. Your students will not see this.  
4) Click "Create New App" and click on the app name after creation to go to the Firebase server page.  


Setup Steps:
============
1) You need everything in this folder (/attendance/). Copy everything or just git clone the whole repo.  
2) Go to https://appengine.google.com/, sign in with your Google account.  
3) Click "Create Application"  
4) Choose a unique app identifier, and copy it. Your students will see this.     
5) Choose an app name, like FinalAttendance, leave "Open to all Google Account users" checked.    
6) Click "create application"  
7) Follow these commands:  
$ cd ClassStuff/attendance/ # or wherever you put the attendance/ folder  
$ source make_attendance.sh <app_name> <app_id> # Use them from steps 4 and 5
8) Follow the onscreen commands. The first command will ask for the url of your Firebase server. This can be found from URL on the page in step 4 of the "Firebase" section above.  
9) Google app engine will ask you to login with your account. At this point, the attendance web app should be deployed and can be found at http://<app_id>.appspot.com
